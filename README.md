# Songs-vs-Headlines

Art tends to imitate life. Through this analysis, I wish to compare the titles of randomly selected songs in the late-90's to newspaper headlines during that same time period. Wordclouds and the use of a Shiny App will provide the comparison for the most commonly used words/phrases from both sources.

A subset of the Million Songs Database was used for song titles while a subset of NYT Headlines were used for newspaper data.
